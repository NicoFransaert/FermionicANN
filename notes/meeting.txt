Fermionic hamiltonian: 
    - the c's refer to basis functions.
    - The SB and TB integrals are defined solely by basis choice.

Mapping:
    - The mapping requires bonds which scale very bad.
    - The last c_j maps to 2**(systemsize) bonds.
    - The optimization requires 1e5 samples per iteration.

Lattice:
    - The size of the lattice = # of modes =? # of basis functions?
    - They have 20 "spin orbitals" for STO-3G, but we would get 10 lattice sites.
    - Has this something to do with restricted/unrestricted? We would think not.

Matrix elements:
    - There is a trick for matrix elements, to get only contributions with sigma_i and sigma_z.
    - All of our matrix elements involve sigma_z tho, thus... Yeah

Goals:
    - Be happy
    - STO-3G as starting basis set - maybe improve to 6-31g when everything works.
    - Initial goal; calculation of the ground state energy @ equilibrium distance for H2 or N2
    - End goal: dissociation curves
    - Extra: try RNN? Other basis sets, other molecules...
